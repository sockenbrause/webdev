clean your code 

algorythm

-the idea:
create a program that takes "dirty" html code with lines of style attributes 
and devide it into two textfiles, one with the html code and one with 
the css code. the user shall be able to decide, if certain css code shall be 
created as a class or with tag-links.

an extended version will also separate scripts into a javascriptfile

-the algorythm

create a prompt that can take the copied html code as a pasted string.

check the code line by line for the keyword style=
string.indexOf(searchstring, startposition) gives back the first appearence of the searched string.
store the index in an array.
repeat with the new startposition that is index+5, until the  end of the string is reached.
(do while?)
